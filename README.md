clean_qgis_interface_add_new_toolbar
================

This plugin was developed to support CLWSC's GDI Desktop application. GDI Desktop is built on QGIS. The plugin removes all of the toolbars from a default install of QGIS and then adds a custom search dialog. The goal of this plugin is to greatly dumb-down the QGIS default user interface for people that don't have any experience using QGIS let a lone a traditional desktop GIS application.
